# Welcome to my code portfolio!
My name is Illya Kuzmych and I am a senior at the University of Washington in Seattle Washington
In this repository you will find code I have written and utilized for a variety of projects.


## Here is what each branch is and what is contained within it:


## C-algorithms:
  In this branch, I have many different embedded system related C algorithms. For example,
  an algorithm that counts the number of set bits in an integer.
  
## Frogger
  In this branch, I have the code-base for my "Frogger" project implemented with a DE1_SoC
  FPGA. This code is entirely in SystemVerilog and utilizes logic gates and LED drivers to create the game!
