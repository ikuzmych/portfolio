# Welcome to my code portfolio!
My name is Illya Kuzmych and I am a senior at the University of Washington in Seattle Washington
In this repository you will find code I have written and utilized for a variety of projects.


## Here is what each branch is and what is contained within it:


## C-algorithms:
  In this branch, I have many different embedded system related C algorithms. For example,
  an algorithm that counts the number of set bits in an integer.
  
## Frogger
  In this branch, I have the code-base for my "Frogger" project implemented with a DE1_SoC
  FPGA. This code is entirely in SystemVerilog and utilizes logic gates and LED drivers to create the game!
  
## Mazes
  In this branch, I have the code-base for an algorithmic maze solver. First, we carve out a maze utilizing Kruskal's Maze Carver. We then utilize Dijkstra's to find the   shortest, existing path
  
## Pong
  In this branch, I have the code-base for a project which focused on implementing algorithms on hardware (DE1_SoC FPGA) to implement a user-controlled game. We utilized   Bresenham's line algorithm to map out the trajectory of the pong ball, and a custom detection algorithm to change the trajectory/slope of the ball on impact with the     user-controlled paddles which were controlled by an 8-bit Nintendo controller

## Proximity Sensor
  In this branch, I have the code and freeRTOS drivers for Arduino which we utilized to build a fail-safe proximity sensor system for construction workers who work in     the dark. We utilized task creation and a pre-emptive scheduler to assign task priorities and build our task schedule.

## Rational Number Calculator
  This branch contains C++ code for a rational number calculator. 

## Simple Poker Game
  This branch contains C code and logic to implement a basic poker game, including deck shuffling and hand detection.
